# Multi-object-recogniser-with-CNN
Download the “vehicles” dataset from here and adapt your CNN from the lab session to 
recognise the 4 object types in the dataset. Generate a graphical plot of  your training and 
validation accuracy during training. Then answer the following questions: 
• How long does the network need to train until reaching an accuracy of  95% (or 
does it not reach this level at all)? 
• What is the tradeoff  between using many layers (i.e. having a “deeper” network) and 
accuracy? And layers and time? 
• What is the effect of  changing the pooling mechanism, e.g. average vs max? 
As a follow-on part, collect your own dataset of  images containing the four object 
categories above. Make sure that they occur in different context, e.g. close-up, far-away, in a 
busy visual context, in an isolated image, etc. It is up to you how you collect these images- you 
can either take photos yourself  or collect images from the internet. You should collect 20 
images and copy these into your report, so I can see them.  
• How well does your network do at classifying these images? 
• Does fine-tuning make a difference?
